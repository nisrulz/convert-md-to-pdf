# Integration Guide

This is some sample text which is used in place for description.

# Step 1

This is the first step, so make sure you get it right. Starting is usually the hardest 😅

```kotlin
fun main(){
    // Function definition
    fun printHelloWorld() = println("👋🏼 🌍")
    
    // Call the function
    printHelloWorld()
}
```

# Step 2

This is the last step. This is where you let out a sigh of relief, that its over \*phew\* 😅
